# Zrd

A minimal text editor with both Terminal UI (TUI) and GUI interfaces. Both interfaces share the same editing engine and operate on a single persistent file for seamless synchronization.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
cargo install --path zrd-tui

# Run from anywhere
zrd
```

Both editors automatically sync via `~/.config/zrd/default.txt`.

## Features

- **Dual Interface**: Terminal UI (Ratatui) and GUI (GPUI)
- **Shared State**: Both editors operate on single file with live reloading
- **Complete Editing**: Full navigation, selection, deletion with Mac-style shortcuts
- **Undo/Redo**: Intelligent change tracking
- **Line Operations**: Move, delete, duplicate lines
- **Word Operations**: Navigate and delete by word boundaries
- **Auto-Save**: Every edit instantly persisted
- **Visual Selection**: Clear highlighting for selected text

## Architecture

```
zrd-core    # Shared editing engine (26 tests passing)
zrd-tui     # Terminal interface (Ratatui)
zrd-gpui    # GUI interface (GPUI)
```

All editing logic lives in `zrd-core` to ensure identical behavior.
