# Zrd Usage Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install TUI (terminal) editor
cargo install --path zrd

# Run it
zrd
```

The `zrd` command opens your scratchpad at `~/.config/zrd/default.txt`

## Shared State

Both the TUI and GPUI versions work on the **same file**: `~/.config/zrd/default.txt`

- Changes auto-save after every keystroke
- Switch between editors seamlessly
- Your work is always persisted

## Running Both Editors

### Terminal (TUI)
```bash
zrd              # Exit with Ctrl+W
```

### GUI (GPUI)
```bash
cargo run -p zrd-gui
```

## List Continuation

Smart list continuation works in both editors:

```
Type: - First item
Press Enter
→ Automatically creates: -

Type: 1. First item
Press Enter
→ Automatically creates: 2.
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Quick notes in terminal
zrd
# Type meeting notes
# Ctrl+W to quit (auto-saved)

# Afternoon: Expand in GUI with nice font
cargo run -p zrd-gui
# Continue editing same file
# Close window (auto-saved)

# Evening: Review in terminal
zrd
# All your work from both sessions is there
```

## File Location

Your scratchpad file: `~/.config/zrd/default.txt`

You can directly edit this file or use either editor - they all stay in sync.
